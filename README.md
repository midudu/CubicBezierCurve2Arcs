* This project is to convert a cubic [Bezier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Higher-order_curves "Bezier curve") to a series of arcs.

* The algorithm used in this project is from the [paper](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82292112.pdf "Approximation of a planar cubic Bezier spiral by circular arcs") "Approximation of a planar cubic Bezier spiral by circular arcs, D.J. Walton*, D.S. Meek".

* The main function in the "TestBezierCurveToArcs" class provides an example of how to use this tool.

* A javascript file is added to the example folder to zoom and move the svg object. This javascript file is from the [svg-pan-zoom](https://github.com/ariutta/svg-pan-zoom  "svg-pan-zoom") repository.

* Make sure the "svg-pan-zoom.js" file and the .html file generated by this tool in the same folder.
